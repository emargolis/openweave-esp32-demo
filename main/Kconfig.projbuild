        help
            Specifies the type of ESP32 device.
            
            Note that the "ESP32-DevKitC" choice is compatible with a number of clone devices
            available from third-party manufacturers.

    # NOTE: This config is not displayed as a input in the Kconfig menu, as its value is
    # entirely derived from the Device Type choice.  However the CONFIG_EXAMPLE_DISPLAY_TYPE
    # define that is produced is needed to configure the TFT library correctly.

    config EXAMPLE_DISPLAY_TYPE
        int
        range 0 3
        default 0 if DEVICE_TYPE_ESP32_DEVKITC
        default 3 if DEVICE_TYPE_M5STACK

    config FACTORY_RESET_BUTTON_DURATION
        int "Factory Reset Button Duration (ms)"
        range 0 65535
        default 5000
        help
            The amount of time (in milliseconds) that the user must press the attention
            button to initiate a factory reset.

    config ENABLE_LIGHTING_DEMO_FEATURE
        bool "Enable Lighting Demo Feature"
        default true
        help
            Enable the lighting control demonstration feature of the demo app.

    config LIGHTING_CONTROLLER_DEVICE_ID
        hex "Lighting Controller Device Id"
        default 18B4300000000001
        depends on ENABLE_LIGHTING_DEMO_FEATURE
        help
            Specifies the node id of device that is acting as the lighting controller.
            
            When the device boots, if the software detects that the lighting controller
            device id matches the device's id, then the device initializes itself to act
            as a lighting controller.  If not, the device initializes itself to act as
            a remote switch.  

    config ALIVE_INTERVAL
        int "Alive Interval (ms)"
        range 0 65535

        help
            Configures the demo application to periodically print an "Alive" message
            confirming that the Weave thread is alive and processing events.  A value
            of 0 disables the feature.

    config SERVICE_ECHO_INTERVAL
        int "Service Echo Interval (ms)"
        range 0 65535
        default 0
        help
            Configures the demo application to periodically send Weave EchoRequest messages
            to the Nest service whenever the service tunnel is up.  A value of 0 disables
            the feature.
